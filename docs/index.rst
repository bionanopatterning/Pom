Introduction
__________

The Pom Python module was created as a part of a project to explore many-feature segmentations of large cryoET dataset, and their use in scaling up the application of common cryoET data analyses such as particle picking and template matching. The project is described in detail in our `preprint <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.16.633326v1>`_, and the segmentation results can be explored `here <https://cryopom.streamlit.app/>`_

In this documentation, we outline the use of Pom in performing the workflow described in the original article.
